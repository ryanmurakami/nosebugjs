nosebug.js
=========

A micro-Handlebars template loader.

Micro meaning very, very small (300 bytes minified);

###Philosophy
By focusing on convention, nosebug can be much smaller and "just work." In other words, it just loads your templates.

###Usage
nosebug is written in vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies. 

- Include nosebug.min.js at the beginning of your html.
- Place the template for that file in the Templates file.
- Name the template file: &lt;name of html file&gt;Template.hbs
- Have fun.

###Browser Support
Tested in Chrome 34, Firefox 28, and IE11.
