nosebug.js
=========

A micro-Handlebars template loader.

###Philosophy
By focusing on convention, nosebug can be much smaller and "just work." In other words, it just loads your templates.

###Usage
nosebug is written in vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies. 

- Include nosebug.min.js in your html
- Place the template for that file in the Template folder
- Name the template file: &lt;name of html file&gt;Template.hbs
- Have fun!

###Browser Support
Tested in Chrome 34, Firefox 28, Safari 8, and IE8+.
